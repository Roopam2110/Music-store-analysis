# Music-store-analysis
I'm thrilled to present my latest SQL project: an in-depth analysis of a music store database. This project involved exploring sales patterns, customer behavior, genre popularity, and artist performance to derive actionable business insights. Key discoveries include pinpointing top-performing markets, highlighting long-tenured employees, and revealing regional customer preferences. Utilizing PostgreSQL and pgAdmin4, I converted raw data into valuable intelligence, offering opportunities to enhance inventory management, elevate customer experience, and drive overall revenue growth.
